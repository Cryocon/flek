In no particular order :

* Tweak installation and packaging ..

* Menu Replacement --

  Should be able to "tear off".  
  Items should be able to have a pixmap.
  Individual items can be "hidden".
  More robust.
  Better dynamic API than Fl_Menu.
  
* About Window --
  
  FltkWindow :: Fl_About (title, version, copyright, authors, comments, logo);

* More Dock Acceptors --

  Fl_Tile
  Fl_Pack
  Fl_Tabs
  
* Interprocess communication and "swallowed" windows.  see MRPC / tinymico.

* Fl_Dockable_Group - needs a function to save and load the state of the 
    floating and docked items.
    
* 3D controllers (scale, rotate, translate)  Like Gleem.

* Themes and scheme support for Fltk 2.0.
