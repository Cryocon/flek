The Usual Routine
-----------------

  ./configure
  make
  make install

There are also a number of make and install options.

CONFIGURE OPTIONS
-----------------

--with-fltk=dir         Specify the base fltk prefix if non standard.

--with-fltk-dir=dir     Specify the SOURCE dir where Fltk resides.  This is
                        useful if Fltk is on your system but hasn't been
                        installed.

--with-gl=dir           Specify the base OpenGL prefix if non standard.

--with-xml=dir          Specify the base libxml prefix if non standard.

--with-fltk2            Use Fltk 2 (cvs) and not Fltk 1.0.7.
                        This is required to get Flek to compile with FLTK_2.

--enable-shared         Build shared libraries (DSO).  These are not built by
                        default.

MAKE OPTIONS
------------

If you are missing either libxml, fltk, or OpenGL/Mesa, you should install
them and then follow the above instructions.  If you can't or don't want to
and you sort of know what you are doing, keep reading.

From the "src" directory you can optionally build and install the different
Flek components seperately.  You will need to do this if, for example you 
don't have (or want) libxml or OpenGL or even Fltk installed on your system.
I have one project that only uses flek-core, so on some systems that's all I
need to build and install.

  cd src

  make flek-core         # Build libflek_core
  make flek-ui           # Build libflek_ui, needs flek_core, and fltk.
  make flek-gl           # Build libflek_gl, needs flek_core, flek_ui, and OpenGL.
  make flek-xml          # Build libflek_xml, needs flek_core, and libxml.
  
  make flek-core-install # Install libflek_core
  make flek-ui-install   # Install libflek_ui
  make flek-gl-install   # Install libflek_gl
  make flek-xml-install  # Install libflek_xml
  
BUILDING RPMS (ADVANCED USERS)
------------------------------

The top level Makefile can also build an RPM "automagically" by typing:

  make rpm
  
Please read the top level Makefile to see what is about to happen and check
over the spec file, too.  Remember, I warned you.  This is here to make 
rpm building convenient.
