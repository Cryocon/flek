    <h2>fDom</h2>
    <p>fDom is the Flek document object model.  fDom provides a logical 
      structure and API for accessing and manipulating documents.  The term 
      "document" is used in a very broad sense.  A document may be 
      comprised of any sort of information or data.
    <p>fDom attempts to synthesize ideas and features of the W3's 
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/DOM/">DOM</a> and XML,  Apple's OpenDoc, 
      and several other document models.  fDom is most similar to DOM, except 
      that it provides fewer structural primitives and allows the programmer 
      more freedom in subclassing nodes.  In these respects fDom is more
      similar to OpenDoc.
    <p>fDom is also <i>incomplete</i>!  The implementation still lacks a mechanism 
      to allow for remote method invocation, and Flek / Fltk currently
      lack the functionality necessary to embed remote parts.  Both of
      these capabilites are necessary for componentized documents.

    <blockquote>
      <h4>fDomNode</h4>
      <p>The primary currency of information within fDom is the node.
	Nodes exist as entities in a hierarchical tree.  A single node
	may have a parent node, multiple daughter nodes, a set of
	attributes, and a set of connected listeners.  A node without
	a parent is the document root.
      <p>The <b>fDomTextNode</b> subclass is a special node that 
	represents a block of text.
      <p>The <b>fDomDynamicNode</b> is a subclass whose name is dynamic.
	In some applications the programmer may not want to define
	fDom classes for every element she intends to use.  These abstract
	elements may be represented by an fDomDynamicNode.  In most
	applications where a well defined document is desirable, using
	fDomDynamicNode is <b>not</b> desireable.
      <h4>fDomAttribute</h4>
      <p>Certain kinds of information associated with a single node
	may be expressed in key-value pairs called "attributes".  When
	stored in XML format these become the attributes for a given
	tag.
      <h4>fDomListener</h4>
      <p>Listeners can be connected to individual nodes and will "listen"
	for events.  One common use is to notify anything connected to
	the document that data in the document has been changed.
