FLEK  (The Fast Light Environment Kit)

Flek intends to provide a layer of standard widgets and libraries that 
provide similar capabilities to and can be integrated with other 
"Environment Kits" like Gnome and KDE.  Right now it only includes a
few additional widgets.

Flek is still in development but in the short term it should include these
libraries:

  libflek-ui    (in progress)

     A collection of useful widgets not in the Fltk distribution.
     
  libflek-dom   (fleshing out API)
  
     A DOM 2 layer built on top of libxml.

libflek-ui currently includes :

Fl_App
Fl_Dockable_Group
Fl_Pack_Fu
Fl_Toggle_Tree
Fl_Calendar

See the docs/ directory for more information on each widget.

COMPILE instructions:

  make

Wasn't that easy?
